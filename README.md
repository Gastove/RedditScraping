# Reddit Scraping

This is designed to collect Reddit usernames from a subreddit and add them to a
database. It then scrapes the comments associted with each user in the
database. Much of the design is based off the the "Weekend Project" by David
Marx. 

That project can be found at https://github.com/dmarx/Scrape-Subreddit-Users
